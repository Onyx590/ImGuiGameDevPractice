# Image rendering foundation project
In this small learning project, I am building a program that renders shapes from a configuration file. This learning project is my first step in building a 2D game engine. 
my goal is to draw moving shapes that render on the screen. These shapes should be scaleable and should boundce off the edges of the screen. 

One thing that you will notice in this project is the console output statements that I used for debugging purposes.
So, if you notice a buch of numbers printing infinitely in your command line console, those are printing for debugging purposes.

For Now, I am going to have to come back to this project later for restructuring 
I need to restructure this in an ECS format
